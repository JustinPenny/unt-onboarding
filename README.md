# Onboarding for CSE grad students

Most UNT CSE grad students come from out of the DFW area (or even the US). It would be great to have an app that they could use as they plan to come here and once they arrive to help them settle in to the area, UNT, and the department.

Information would need seed the app, but this would be an excellent chance for students to crowdsource helpful information for each other (e.g. the students from fall can share their insights with students starting in the spring). Also, the app could help provide a way for students to manage useful and important information that may otherwise be spread across multiple sources.
